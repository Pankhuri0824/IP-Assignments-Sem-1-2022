There are three primary colors (blue, yellow, and red), and How I Met Your Mother contains a symbol for each: the blue 
French horn, the yellow umbrella, and the red boots. Alone, each of these symbols doesn't mean much, but there's a lot 
of meaning in their contrast.

The blue French horn represents Ted actively pursuing and doing anything for love. He seeks out Robin throughout the 
entire series, just as he repeatedly goes out of his way to get the blue French horn. He didn't stumble upon the blue 
French horn; he went after it. The horn also represents permanenceâ€”Ted ultimately gets it back at the end of the series 
despite having lost it earlier. He can always go back to the horn, as he can always go back to Robin.

The yellow umbrella represents love coming from unexpected places and times, or fate. The umbrella came into Ted's life 
without him really needing to do anything, just as Tracy did. This is a stark contrast to the blue French horn: Ted needed
 to perform a rain dance to be with Robin, but with Tracy, it was already raining (hence the umbrella). Finally, just as 
 Ted lost Tracy, we similarly see the umbrella blowing away, implying that it symbolizes loss and moving on, the opposite
  of permanence.

The red boots represent everything in between. The remainder of Ted's relationships consist of him refusing to acknowledge
that they won't work out, just as he refuses to acknowledge that he is not "pulling them off" when he wears the red boots.

Together, the blue French horn and the yellow umbrella represent Ted's two very different love stories: one that is driven
 by him, and one that is driven by fate
